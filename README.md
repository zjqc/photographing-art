# photographing-art
This repo can be regraded as a notebook during my learning process in the field of photographing.😃

As a documentary photographer, gorgeous colors and works that perfectly match the current public aesthetic are not my pursuit. I have always believed that photography, as a visual art that has only been around for 180 years since its inception, not only carries the aesthetic artistic value determined by its physical and chemical processes, but also bears certain cultural and social responsibilities in today's streaming media era.

作为一个纪实摄影师，华丽的色彩以及绝对契合当下大众审美的作品并不是我的追求，我始终认为摄影作为一门从诞生之日起至今不过180年的视觉艺术，其既承载了由其制作的物理化学过程决定的美学艺术价值，也在当今流媒体时代承担着一定的文化和社会责任。

The first chapter photo I am presenting below is my first true documentary photography work. (Although you can also understand it as a street photography work, I prefer to label it as a documentary work)

下面我展示的第一章照片是我真正意义上的第一张纪实摄影作品。（虽然你也可以把它理解为一张街拍作品，但是我更倾向于以纪实作品来标记它）
